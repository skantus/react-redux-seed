## how to start the project ðŸ”¨

- Use `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- With `npm start` you can see the project in action.
- To execute all the **_"tests"_** use `npm run test`.
- If you want "build" the project to **_prod_**, go to _index.js_ in the root, change **_"unregister()"_** by **_"register()"_** then run `npm run build`.
- Finally if you did the last step so you can see the **_"build"_** file in your work area, then you can run it using **_http-server_** or something like this.
